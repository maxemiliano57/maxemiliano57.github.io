### 3. **Lab 10**
- **Description:** The assignment focuses on utilizing JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event-based content updates.

Part 1: Edited the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make non-functional links work and dynamically insert/replace page content using DOM events.
Part 2: Wrote external JavaScript (dom_scripting.js) to dynamically create and insert additional markup into the page, following the provided screenshot as a reference.

All files were organized into appropriate directories (html, css, img, and js) for server upload and tested for functionality.

### 4. **Lab 11**
- **Description:** The assignment focuses on creating a dynamic image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to replicate the functionality shown in the provided screencast by implementing event listeners and DOM manipulation. Thumbnails trigger the display of full-size images, which are dynamically created and removed using JavaScript. The HTML is indented to show parent/child relationships and validates against HTML5 standards. For a challenge, additional features include storing image data in arrays and displaying captions below full-size images. All files are organized into respective directories for proper structure.

### 5. **Assignment 1**
- **Description:** The assignment involves creating a program that converts user-entered Strings into "ROBOT Language" and displays the results in the console. The program consists of three main parts: accepting a user input String, converting it based on specified rules, and writing the result to the console. Users can navigate through a Main Menu to enter a String, convert it, display the result, or exit the program. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit. All code follows best practices for indentation, proper file structure, and validation, with the JavaScript stored externally in a robot.js file within the js directory.

  ### 6. **Assignment 2**
- **Description:** The assignment focuses on creating a survey form with form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form collects user input, validates it with JavaScript using patterns and hints, and displays the results dynamically on the page. Users are shown a badge based on their survey responses, and logic determines the badge displayed. The form includes personal information inputs (name, phone, email, URL) and at least two survey questions with radio buttons. All files are organized into appropriate directories for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
